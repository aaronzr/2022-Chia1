 ## Project Overview
 
 We are reimagining a sustainable future of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. We plan to build a DeFi product on top of Chia that leverages Chia's energy and time efficient consensus mechansism.

# Team Meeting notes
## Feb 7
We discussed the feedback we received from our liaison and our VC guest last week.
We're looking into building a subset of what we pitched to the VC in order to
make it more feasible that we can build something in 1.5 quarters.

Ideas discussed in [OKRs and KPIs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OHoNefildGwwCYHj2ygEQYmbYHIhpuSBs7_-v6s45W0/edit):

Idea | Info
--- | ---
Chia wallet | Joe's suggestion. Already built: [nucle.io]. Should we try to interface with this or build our own?
NFT platform | Allow people to mint NFTs on Chia. Good middle-ground for feasibility. Functionality similar to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/asset/create) or [Polygon](https://docs.polygon.technology/). Assumes we can connect to a Chia wallet.
Music royalty distribution | The original idea. Probably not achievable in 1.5 quarters.

We met up and presented our respective research areas.
Below are links to resources and insights:

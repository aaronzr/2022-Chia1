## On-chain COVID tests
 
The politically contentious status of workplace vaccine mandates, international travel restrictions, and fear due to vaccine misinformation creates a strong incentive for faked COVID test results. **(Finn fill in)**

Pros/Value-adds |  Cons/Challenges | 
--- | --- 
More difficult for individuals to fake COVID tests = less risk to public health through dishonest behavior | Risk of fake COVID labs abusing the platform to grant fake results. Need to have a system in place for vetting trusted labs 
etc. | etc.
 
## On-chain carbon credits

Carbon credits are supposed to track and set limits on companies' carbon emissions, but corporations and governments both have economic incentive to "cheat" by misreporting their emissions. A trustless, verifiable way to track emissions is necessary to hold powerful entities accountable. **(Ende fill in)**

Pros/Value-adds |  Cons/Challenges | 
--- | --- 
Trustless and objective as long as _most_ countries agree on a correct blockchain | Still may be possible to sabotage on the level of large corps/govts by simply lying about emissions (how are carbon credits verified today?)
etc. | etc.

## On-chain music royalty distribution

Back in the day (until c. 2000s), musicians had to sign a contract with a record company (e.g. Sony, RCA Victor) in order to sell their music on vinyl and/or CDs. This, of course, required a lot of trust in the record company on the part of the artists and often gave record companies undue influence over their artists, e.g., telling them what kind of music to write based on what sells.  The system also indirectly punished artists for being too innovative, since it was risky for record companies to sign someone who deviates too much from the mainstream.

Digital streaming services (Pandora, iTunes/Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.) opened up the market by allowing artists and audiences to connect more easily, giving musicians more autonomy and freedom. However, the payment model also changed: musicians went from making dollars per album sold in record stores, to cents per song bought on iTunes, to fractions of a cent per Spotify stream.



Other platforms that are more directly artist-facing (Soundcloud, Bandcamp) give an artist easy access to publish music, but are harder to monetize, pay less, and have far less reach than more mainstream platforms.
